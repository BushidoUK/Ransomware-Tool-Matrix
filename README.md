# Ransomware Tool Matrix
- This repository contains a list of which tools each ransomware gang or extortionist gang uses
- As defenders, we should exploit the fact that many of the tools used by these cybercriminals are often reused
- We can threat hunt, deploy detections, and block these tools to eliminate the ability of adversaries to launch intrusions
- This project will be updated as additional intelligence on ransomware gang TTPs is made available
- Feel free to watch my presentation on this project at [BSides London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyoOhAoaX1g) in December 2024.

> [!TIP]
>  This Ransomware Tool Matrix has several use cases, which are as follows:
> - As a list of leads for threat hunting inside the environments available to you
> - As a list of leads to look for during incident response engagements
> - As a checklist of tools to identify patterns of behaviour between certain ransomware affiliates
> - As an adversary emulation resource for threat intelligence-led purple team engagements

## Types of Ransomware Adversaries
> [!TIP]
> This repo also contains multiple types of Ransomware adversaries, this includes the ransomware gangs themselves, affiliates, and initial access brokers
> - **Ransomware Gangs:** In this repo, a tool is associated with a ransomware gang, meaning that the tool was observed in an intrusion which resulted in the deployment of that ransomware family
> - **Affiliates:** A threat group in this repo with an asterisk at the end (e.g. Scattered Spider*), means it is a ransomware affiliate, which has access to one or more ransomware families
> - **Initial Access Brokers:** A threat group in this repo with an asterisk at the start (e.g. *Prophet Spider), means it is an Initial Access Broker (IAB), which sells access to one or more ransomware gangs
> - **State-sponsored:** A threat group in this repo with a plus sign at the end (e.g. DarkBit+), means it is a suspected state-sponosored adversary using ransomware, such as those from Iran, DPRK, Russia, or China

## Challenges
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using the Ransomware Tool Matrix comes with its own challenges. While it is undoubtedly useful to have a list of tools commonly used by ransomware gangs to hunt, detect, and block, there are some risks.
> - Many of the tools referenced in this repository may be currently used by your IT team or even your Cybersecurity team.
> - When hunting for these tools, you may uncover many installations of them inside your environment.
> - Deciphering whether a tool is being used legitimately, by an employee, with permission is difficult in a large or global environment.
> - If you create a detection rule, you may generate a large amount of alerts, which may get ignore or turned off without investigating them.
> - If you block these tools without investigating for legitimate usage, you may cause disruption to legitimate business operations and potentially impose costs on your own organisation.
