## Offensive Security Tools

> [!TIP]
> Offensive security tools are developed by professional ethical hackers to simulate cyber-attacks and evaluate an organization's defenses. These tools offer powerful features for post-exploitation activities, such as stealthy communications, lateral movement, and advanced command and control capabilities. Some tools focus on evasion techniques to bypass modern security defenses, allowing for realistic threat simulations and payload development. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cybercriminals can obtain offensive security tools through various means, often exploiting legitimate channels or resorting to illegal methods to acquire them. These tools also allow attackers to automate parts of their attacks, making them more efficient and widespread.
